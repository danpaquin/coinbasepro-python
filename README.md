## Benefits
- A simple to use python wrapper for both public and authenticated endpoints.
- In about 10 minutes, you could be programmatically trading on one of the
largest Bitcoin exchanges in the *world*!
- Do not worry about handling the nuances of the API with easy-to-use methods
for every API endpoint.
- Gain an advantage in the market by getting under the hood of GDAX to learn
what and who is *really* behind every tick.

## Under Development
- Test Scripts
- Additional Functionality for the real-time order book
- FIX API Client **Looking for assistance**

## Getting Started
This README is documentation on the syntax of the python client presented in
this repository. See function docstrings for full syntax details.  
**This API attempts to present a clean interface to GDAX, but in order to use it
to its full potential, you must familiarize yourself with the official GDAX
documentation.**

- https://docs.gdax.com/

- You may manually install the project or use ```pip```:
```python
pip install gdax
```

### Public Client
Only some endpoints in the API are available to everyone.  The public endpoints
can be reached using ```PublicClient```

```python
import gdax
public_client = gdax.PublicClient()
```

### PublicClient Methods
- [get_products](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-products)
```python
public_client.get_products()
```

- [get_product_order_book](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-product-order-book)
```python
# Get the order book at the default level.
public_client.get_product_order_book('BTC-USD')
# Get the order book at a specific level.
public_client.get_product_order_book('BTC-USD', level=1)
```

- [get_product_ticker](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-product-ticker)
```python
# Get the product ticker for a specific product.
public_client.get_product_ticker(product_id='ETH-USD')
```

- [get_product_trades](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-trades)
```python
# Get the product trades for a specific product.
public_client.get_product_trades(product_id='ETH-USD')
```

- [get_product_historic_rates](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-historic-rates)
```python
public_client.get_product_historic_rates('ETH-USD')
# To include other parameters, see function docstring:
public_client.get_product_historic_rates('ETH-USD', granularity=3000)
```

- [get_product_24hr_stats](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-24hr-stats)
```python
public_client.get_product_24hr_stats('ETH-USD')
```

- [get_currencies](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-currencies)
```python
public_client.get_currencies()
```

- [get_time](https://docs.gdax.com/#time)
```python
public_client.get_time()
```

### Authenticated Client

Not all API endpoints are available to everyone.
Those requiring user authentication can be reached using `AuthenticatedClient`.
You must setup API access within your
[account settings](https://www.gdax.com/settings/api).
The `AuthenticatedClient` inherits all methods from the `PublicClient`
class, so you will only need to initialize one if you are planning to
integrate both into your script.

```python
import gdax
auth_client = gdax.AuthenticatedClient(key, b64secret, passphrase)

# Use the sandbox API (requires a different set of API access credentials)
auth_client = gdax.AuthenticatedClient(key, b64secret, passphrase,
                                  api_url="https://api-public.sandbox.gdax.com")
```

### Pagination
Some calls are [paginated](https://docs.gdax.com/#pagination), meaning multiple
calls must be made to receive the full set of data.  Each page/request is a list
of dict objects that are then appended to a master list, making it easy to
navigate pages (e.g. ```request[0]``` would return the first page of data in the
example below). *This feature is under consideration for redesign.  Please
provide feedback if you have issues or suggestions*
```python
request = auth_client.get_fills(limit=100)
request[0] # Page 1 always present
request[1] # Page 2+ present only if the data exists
```
It should be noted that limit does not behave exactly as the official
documentation specifies.  If you request a limit and that limit is met,
additional pages will not be returned.  This is to ensure speedy response times
when less data is preferred.

### AuthenticatedClient Methods

```

# Buy 0.01 BTC @ 100 USD
auth_client.buy(price='100.00', #USD
               size='0.01', #BTC
               product_id='BTC-USD')
```
```python
# Sell 0.01 BTC @ 200 USD
auth_client.sell(price='200.00', #USD
                size='0.01', #BTC
                product_id='BTC-USD')
```

# Get fills for a specific product
auth_client.get_fills(product_id="ETH-BTC")
```

- [deposit & withdraw](https://docs.gdax.com/#depositwithdraw)
```python
gdax
depositParams = {
        'amount': '25.00', # Currency determined by account specified
        'coinbase_account_id': '60680c98bfe96c2601f27e9c'
}
auth_client.deposit(depositParams)
```
```python
# Withdraw from GDAX into Coinbase Wallet
withdrawParams = {
        'amount': '1.00', # Currency determined by account specified
        'coinbase_account_id': '536a541fa9393bb3c7000023'
}
auth_client.withdraw(withdrawParams)
```

### WebsocketClient
If you would like to receive real-time market updates, you must subscribe to the
[websocket feed](https://docs.gdax.com/#websocket-feed).

#### Subscribe to a single product
```python
import gdax
# Paramters are optional
wsClient = gdax.WebsocketClient(url="wss://ws-feed.gdax.com", products="BTC-USD")
# Do other stuff...
wsClient.close()
```

#### Subscribe to multiple products
```python
import gdax
# Paramaters are optional
wsClient = gdax.WebsocketClient(url="wss://ws-feed.gdax.com",
                                products=["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"])
# Do other stuff...
wsClient.close()
```

### WebsocketClient + Mongodb
The ```WebsocketClient``` now supports data gathering via MongoDB. Given a
MongoDB collection, the ```WebsocketClient``` will stream results directly into
the database collection.
```python
# import PyMongo and connect to a local, running Mongo instance
from pymongo import MongoClient
import gdax
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')

# specify the database and collection
db = mongo_client.cryptocurrency_database
BTC_collection = db.BTC_collection

# instantiate a WebsocketClient instance, with a Mongo collection as a parameter
wsClient = gdax.WebsocketClient(url="wss://ws-feed.gdax.com", products="BTC-USD",
    mongo_collection=BTC_collection, should_print=False)
wsClient.start()
```

### WebsocketClient Methods
The ```WebsocketClient``` subscribes in a separate thread upon initialization.
There are three methods which you could overwrite (before initialization) so it
can react to the data streaming in.  The current client is a template used for
illustration purposes only.


- onOpen - called once, *immediately before* the socket connection is made, this
is where you want to add initial parameters.
- onMessage - called once for every message that arrives and accepts one
argument that contains the message of dict type.
- onClose - called once after the websocket has been closed.
- close - call this method to close the websocket connection (do not overwrite).
```python
import gdax, time
class myWebsocketClient(gdax.WebsocketClient):
    def on_open(self):
        self.url = "wss://ws-feed.gdax.com/"
        self.products = ["LTC-USD"]
        self.message_count = 0
        print("Lets count the messages!")
    def on_message(self, msg):
        self.message_count += 1
        if 'price' in msg and 'type' in msg:
            print ("Message type:", msg["type"],
                   "\t@ {:.3f}".format(float(msg["price"])))
    def on_close(self):
        print("-- Goodbye! --")

wsClient = myWebsocketClient()
wsClient.start()
print(wsClient.url, wsClient.products)
while (wsClient.message_count < 500):
    print ("\nmessage_count =", "{} \n".format(wsClient.message_count))
    time.sleep(1)
wsClient.close()
```

## Testing
A test suite is under development. To run the tests, start in the project
directory and run
```
python -m pytest
```

### Real-time OrderBook
The ```OrderBook``` subscribes to a websocket and keeps a real-time record of
the orderbook for the product_id input.  Please provide your feedback for future
improvements.

```python
import gdax, time
order_book = gdax.OrderBook(product_id='BTC-USD')
order_book.start()
time.sleep(10)
order_book.close()
```
