## Benefits
- A simple to use python wrapper for both public and authenticated endpoints.
- In about 10 minutes, you could be programmatically trading on one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the *world*!
- Do not worry about handling the nuances of the API with easy-to-use methods for every API endpoint.
- Gain an advantage in the market by getting under the hood of GDAX to learn what and who is *really* behind every tick.

## Under Development
- Test Scripts **on dev branch**
- Additional Functionality for *WebsocketClient* (including a real-time order book)
- FIX API Client **Looking for support**

## Getting Started
This README is documentation on the syntax of the python client presented in this repository.  **In order to use this wrapper to its full potential, you must familiarize yourself with the official GDAX documentation.**

- https://docs.gdax.com/

- You may manually install the project or use ```pip```:
```python
pip install GDAX
```

### Public Client
Only some endpoints in the API are available to everyone.  The public endpoints can be reached using ```PublicClient```

```python
import GDAX
publicClient = GDAX.PublicClient()
# Set a default product
publicClient = GDAX.PublicClient(product_id="ETH-USD")
```

### PublicClient Methods
- [getProducts](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-products)
```python
publicClient.getProducts()
```

- [getProductOrderBook](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-product-order-book)
```python
# Get the order book at the default level.
publicClient.getProductOrderBook()
# Get the order book at a specfific level.
publicClient.getProductOrderBook(level=1)
```

- [getProductTicker](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-product-ticker)
```python
# Get the product ticker for the default product.
publicClient.getProductTicker()
# Get the product ticker for a specific product.
publicClient.getProductTicker(product="ETH-USD")
```

- [getProductTrades](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-trades)
```python
# Get the product trades for the default product.
publicClient.getProductTrades()
# Get the product trades for a specific product.
publicClient.getProductTrades(product="ETH-USD")
```

- [getProductHistoricRates](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-historic-rates)
```python
publicClient.getProductHistoricRates()
# To include other parameters, see official documentation:
publicClient.getProductHistoricRates(granularity=3000)
```

- [getProduct24HrStates](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-24hr-stats)
```python
publicClient.getProduct24HrStats()
```

- [getCurrencies](https://docs.gdax.com/#get-currencies)
```python
publicClient.getCurrencies()
```

- [getTime](https://docs.gdax.com/#time)
```python
publicClient.getTime()
```

#### *In Development* JSON Parsing
Only available for the `PublicClient`, you may pass any function above raw JSON data.  This may be useful for some applications of the project and should not hinder performance, but we are looking into this.  *Do you love or hate this?  Please share your thoughts within the issue tab!*

- Both of these calls send the same request:
```python
import GDAX
publicClient = GDAX.PublicClient()

method1 = public.getProductHistoricRates(granularity='3000')

params = {
'granularity': '3000'
}
method2 = public.getProductHistoricRates(params)

# Both methods will send the same request, but not always return the same data if run in series.
print (method1, method2)
```



### Authenticated Client
Not all API endpoints are available to everyone.  Those requiring user authentication can be reached using ```AuthenticatedClient```. You must setup API access within your [account settings](https://www.gdax.com/settings/api). The ```AuthenticatedClient``` inherits all methods from the ```PrivateClient``` class, so you will only need to initialize one if you are planning to integrate both into your script.

```python
import GDAX
authClient = GDAX.AuthenticatedClient(key, b64secret, passphrase)
# Set a default product
authClient = GDAX.AuthenticatedClient(key, b64secret, passphrase, product_id="ETH-USD")
# Use the sandbox API (requires a different set of API access crudentials)
authClient = GDAX.AuthenticatedClient(key, b64secret, passphrase, api_url="https://api-public.sandbox.gdax.com")
```

### Pagination
Some calls are [paginated](https://docs.gdax.com/#pagination), meaning multiple calls must be made to receive the full set of data.  Each page/request is a list of dict objects that are then appended to a master list, making it easy to navigate pages (e.g. ```request[0]``` would return the first page of data in the example below). *This feature is under consideration for redesign.  Please provide feedback if you have issues or suggestions*
```python
request = authClient.getFills(limit=100)
request[0] # Page 1 always present
request[1] # Page 2+ present only if the data exists
```
It should be noted that limit does not behave exactly as the official documentation specifies.  If you request a limit and that limit is met, additional pages will not be returned.  This is to ensure speedy response times when less data is prefered.

}
authClient.withdraw(withdrawParams)
```

### WebsocketClient
If you would like to receive real-time market updates, you must subscribe to the [websocket feed](https://docs.gdax.com/#websocket-feed).

#### Subscribe to a single product
```python
import GDAX
# Paramters are optional
wsClient = GDAX.WebsocketClient(ws_url="wss://ws-feed.gdax.com", product_id="BTC-USD")
# Do other stuff...
wsClient.close()
```

#### Subscribe to multiple products
```python
import GDAX
# Paramters are optional
wsClient = GDAX.WebsocketClient(ws_url="wss://ws-feed.gdax.com", product_id=["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"])
# Do other stuff...
wsClient.close()
```

### WebsocketClient Methods
The ```WebsocketClient``` subscribes in a separate thread upon initialization.  There are three methods which you could overwrite (before initialization) so it can react to the data streaming in.  The current client is a template used for illustration purposes only.

- onOpen - called once, *immediately before* the socket connection is made
- onMessage - called once for every message that arrives and accepts one argument that contains the message of dict type.
- onClose - called once after the websocket has been closed.
- close - call this method to close the websocket connection (do not overwrite).
```python
import GDAX, time
class myWebsocketClient(GDAX.WebsocketClient):
    def onOpen(self):
        self.MessageCount = 0
        print "Lets count the messages!"
    def onMessage(self, msg):
        print "Message type:", msg["type"], "\t@ %.3f" % float(msg["price"])
        self.MessageCount += 1
    def onClose(self):
        print "-- Goodbye! --"

wsClient = myWebsocketClient()
wsClient.start()
# Do some logic with the data
while (wsClient.MessageCount < 500):
    print "\nMessageCount =", "%i \n" % wsClient.MessageCount
    time.sleep(1)
wsClient.close()
```
